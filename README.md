Part I
=================

Chosen Gutenberg Documents:

* [Peter Pan](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm) by J. M. Barrie
* [A Tale of Two Cities](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm) by Charles Dickens
* [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm) by Arthur Conan Doyle

HTML Modifications

* I added specific `<div>` and `<span>` tags for inline titles, copyright, and licensing
* Added chapter classes for each chapter.
* In general, I tried to use existing classes in the Gutenberg documents instead of making my own. For instance, using the existing toc class for table of contents.

Style Modifications

* Added custom google fonts for titles and first letter of chapters.
* Text now takes up the entire length of paragraph within margins.
* Increased margin size.
* Made a title page and styled it to look like a book.
* License at bottom of document stands out in red.
* Changed some background colours.
* Necessary changes from requirements.org (header, img, etc...)
