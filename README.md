Part I
=================

Chosen Gutenberg Documents:

* [Peter Pan](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm) by J. M. Barrie
* [A Tale of Two Cities](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm) by Charles Dickens
* [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm) by Arthur Conan Doyle

HTML Modifications

* I added specific <div> and <span> tags for inline titles, copyright, and licenscing
* The original intention was to seperate chapters by <div class="chapter"> tags, to stylize the first letter of each chapter, but there already existed a "smcap" class that did something similar, so I used that.
* In general, I tried to use existing classes in the Gutenberg documents instead of making my own.
